NPM
===

NPM is a package manager. Many believe that NPM stands for "Node Package
Manager". But, in fact, it is a recursive bacronymic abbreviation for "npm is
not an acronym". It is very similar to other package managers, such as Ruby Gems
and PHP Composer. All three, including npm, have the ability to easily run and
install packages fo scripts that you can run.

To install a module, we can call `npm install module`. To install the
underscore module, we call `npm install underscore`. 

All modules installed, are managed within the `node_modules`.
